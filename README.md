# YouTube-Playlist-Shuffler
This is a side project that I will be working on while I go through Tech Elevator's Java development boot camp.

For now I will be getting the shuffling function working. It won't be taking in an actual playlist just yet. That will be figured
out as I continue in the boot camp and figure out how to work with APIs and the sort as I assume I'll need to use an API to get
the functionality that Im looking for.
